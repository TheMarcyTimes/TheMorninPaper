# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

This application provides quick access to current information such as weather updates and upcoming events, making it easy for users to stay informed. It also features a fun Wordle-style game for moments when you need a break or want to challenge yourself.

The application is specifically designed for students at Marcy Lab School, offering a useful tool for staying up-to-date on important information while providing entertainment during downtime.

As a user, I can search for a city to get the current temperature and wind speed, so I can easily stay informed about the weather in different locations.

As a user, I can look up a specific date (e.g., April 1, 2024, or April 1, 2022) and view the events that happened on that day, both in the past and present. This allows me to explore historical moments or keep track of current events.

As a user, I can play a Wordle-style game with multiple difficulty levels (Easy, Normal, Hard) to challenge myself and have fun during my breaks.
